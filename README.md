### Description

Welcome to my virtual space, where technology and creativity converge. As a programming enthusiast, I've crafted this website to serve as my virtual CV. Browsing through the pages, you'll not only discover my past projects, forming my portfolio, but also delve into my current skill set. My experience spans projects in web development and mobile applications, where I've gained practical proficiency in HTML, CSS, JS, and React. I'm constantly evolving, which is why you'll find information on the site about what I'm currently eager to learn.
